# Image-Change

ðŸ–¼ Implementing Image Change on Click with HTML, CSS & JavaScript ðŸ’»ðŸ”„

Just completed a cool feature where an image changes dynamically on an onclick event using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to handle the interactivity. The project allows users to click on an image or button to swap between multiple images, giving the page a more engaging and interactive feel. JavaScriptâ€™s DOM manipulation made it simple to detect user clicks and change the image instantly without reloading the page.

A major challenge was ensuring the feature worked seamlessly across different browsers and devices, while also optimizing image load times for a smooth experience.

Takeaway: This project showed me how powerful even basic JavaScript events can be in enhancing user experience. It also reinforced the importance of performance optimization and cross-browser testing.
